	I think that my degree of success with this project is 99%. The way that I approached
this problem is by firsting starting with the a6main.asm file given by Prof. Moloney and 
using it as my outline. I then went back to my assignment 5 program and split it up into the
necessary functions and modified them as needed based on the new main driver. For the linker,
I started by making a simple program to open a file and copy all of its contents. From there,
I was slowly able to have it take in an arbitrary number of arguments, as well as added 
support for the -o option. The only problem that I was not able to resolve is that my program
does not return -1 in the ac in the case of an overflow. I set the ac to 0 in my addints
function itself, which correctly returns a 0 in the ac upon successful addition. However,
when I tried different ways of setting the ac to -1 in my main function, it would result in
the first prompt being printed endlessly.

My makefile includes all the steps needed to build the seperate assembly files into the a6.o
consolidated object file and the a6.exe executable file. In order to run the executable,
you can use the following line:

./mic1 new_prom.dat a6.exe 0 1024
